🚦 AI Traffic Monitoring and Management System — Prototype
Intelligent Traffic Flow for Smarter Cities

Author: Earl Aduma
Supervisor: Sharon Cherop
Institution: Adanian Labs — AI & Data Science Capstone Project
Year: 2025

🌍 Overview

The AI Traffic Monitoring and Management System is a next-generation intelligent urban mobility solution that integrates AI-powered traffic simulations, real-time analytics, and dynamic visual dashboards.

This system demonstrates how artificial intelligence and data science can revolutionize transportation by predicting congestion, optimizing signal flow, and improving decision-making in city management.

💡 Features

🧠 AI-based traffic simulation (real-time adaptive flow)

📊 Interactive dashboards with live analytics

⚙️ Admin control system (user management, override, lane configuration)

📅 Full-day simulation (morning → noon → evening patterns)

🚨 Emergency vehicle override

🛣️ City grid visualization with direction arrows

📈 Traffic volume & congestion graph

💬 AI Chatbot assistant for user queries

🔄 Data export (CSV, JSON, and reports)

🧭 Objectives

Develop a simulation-driven AI system for intelligent traffic management.

Visualize real-time congestion and traffic direction changes.

Enable administrators to manually or automatically control city-wide traffic flow.

Use predictive analytics to forecast traffic volume changes based on time.

Provide data-driven dashboards for insight generation and policy support.
